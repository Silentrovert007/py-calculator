# Py-calculator
* just a simple calculator. no user interface, it can only run in terminal or IDE.
* for operations like add, subtract, divide, multiply, exponentiation and cotangent, the app prompts the user input for two numbers
* for the remaining operations, a single input is suficient.

## list of operations:
* For the basic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication and division**), the app is going to prompt two user inputs. the inputs must be separated by a space. after that the user waits for the app to give the the result of the operation. the result is going to printed to the screen. after each operation, the app is going to make the user decide if they want to perform another operation (including quit the app).

* For **sin, cosin, tangent and contangent**, the app prompts the user for the angle. those are one of the operations thet require only one input. and it does the same as the others. prints the results to the screen after the inputs.
* The calculation of the **cotangent** is a little bit diferent. the app needs to use data from sin and cosin, meaning that this calculation uses the function sin and cossin in order to have the result. therefore, the user is going to need to input the same angle, twice. and then the app gives the aftermath.
* for the **square-root**, the user needs only one number, and the app is going to do the rest of the calculation.
* for the **power**, the app needs to numbers: the first is the _base_ and the second is the _exponent_. The user has to separate the base and the exponent using a single space. after clicking "enter", the app is going to print the power of the base to the exponent to the screen.
* **Quit** is the last operation. it basically quits the application, and gives a good bye message.

## Notes:
The app works fine, but it has some errors. For example, there are no functions or methods for checking if the user inputs are correct. this is the first point to fix. fixing this issues will allow the program to run with no interruptions.

I'm probably going to add a function to check the user input, and if the inputs are incorrect, the app is going to ask the right input from the user. for example, for those function that require two inputs, if the user puts one input, the app is going to ask him to retype the inputs.
